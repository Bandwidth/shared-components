Spacing
====

      
An experimental component which just adds some padding around something else, based on some pre-defined sizes our designers like. Since developers end up implementing their own padding a lot, it might be useful to include this generic utility. Hopefully it generalizes well.

You can also specify a custom padding for any side, i.e. `top="48px"`. This is probably a bad idea.

```
<Spacing size="sm" bottom="lg">Some content</Spacing>
```
