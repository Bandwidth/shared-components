A helper component to create Redux Form multi-value fields. Supply a `renderField` function prop to render your individual fields, and this component will take care of allowing users to add a new value, delete values, and syncing the values with Redux Form.

`renderField` takes two parameters: `name` and `index`. You can read more in the Redux Form docs.
