```javascript

      </PaneSection>
      <PaneSection title="More">
        Some more content
      </PaneSection>
    </Pane>
    <Pane>
      <PaneSection>
        Number of panes is up to you.
      </PaneSection>
      <PaneSection title="Sections">
        Number of sections is also up to you.
      </PaneSection>
      <PaneSection title="Titles">
        Titles can be provided to Sections.
      </PaneSection>
    </Pane>
    <Pane>
      <PaneSection>
        Some content...<br/>
        With multiple lines...
      </PaneSection>
      <PaneSection>
        Some more content
      </PaneSection>
    </Pane>
  </Pane.Row>
  <Pane.Row>
    <Pane>
      <PaneSection>
        Longer columns will extend further
      </PaneSection>
    </Pane>
    <Pane>
      <PaneSection>
        So you can keep...
      </PaneSection>
    </Pane>
    <Pane>
      <PaneSection>
        Going and going<br />
        Going and going<br />
        Going and going<br />
        Going and going<br />
        Going and going<br />
        Going and going<br />
        Going and going<br />
        (Notice that the lines extend)
      </PaneSection>
    </Pane>
    <Pane>

        Or not.
      </PaneSection>
