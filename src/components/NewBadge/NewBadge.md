```
const theme = require('../../theme').default;
theme.renderDocumentation('NewBadge');
```

NewBadge lets a user quickly find new items that were just created by a previous action. Drop it on any item which just appeared on the page to easily inform the user of changes.

```javascript
<NewBadge />
```
