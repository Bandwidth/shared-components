The trusty button. Renders a `button` tag with styling. You can add fancy little icons with animations using the `leftIcon` and `rightIcon` props. These icons should be names from the icons list (see `components/helpers/icons`).

Change the color with themes, not on the button itself!

**Primary button**
```
<Button rightIcon="checkmark">Ok</Button>
```

**Button with secondary theme applied**
```
<Button.Secondary>Secondary</Button.Secondary>
```
